#### OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS

I am the creator and maintainer of the following open-source projects:

* [Wexflow](https://wexflow.github.io/): Workflow Automation Engine
* [Servy](https://github.com/aelassas/servy): Turn Any App into a Native Windows Service
* [BookCars](https://bookcars.github.io/): Car Rental Platform with Mobile App
* [Movin' In](https://movin-in.github.io/): Rental Property Management Platform with Mobile App
* [wexCommerce](https://wexcommerce.github.io/): Single-Vendor Marketplace

By choosing my solutions, you can launch your own digital marketplace — whether it's an ecommerce website, car rental platform, or property rental system. Each solution comes with comprehensive documentation, Stripe and PayPal payment integration, and runs efficiently on just 1GB of RAM. Deploy your business for less than $5/month on cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets), perfect for anyone seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions.

If BookCars, Wexflow, Servy, or any of my projects have helped you, saved you time, or inspired you in any way, please consider supporting their future growth and maintenance. You can show your support by starring the repository, sharing the project, or making a donation via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/aelassas) (one-time or monthly), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/aelassaspp), or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/aelassas). Every bit of support helps keep the projects active, maintained, and accessible to all.
