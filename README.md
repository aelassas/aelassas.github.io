I specialize in crafting innovative and scalable solutions for digital media, backed by years of software engineering expertise. My comprehensive experience spans web, mobile, and desktop development, with particular focus on media and digital asset management systems.

My core strength is developing forward-thinking solutions that adapt across industries, helping organizations modernize their workflows and optimize data management. I transform complex business challenges into streamlined, automated processes that drive efficiency and growth.

I am the creator and maintainer of the following open-source projects:

* [Wexflow](https://github.com/aelassas/wexflow): .NET Workflow Engine and Automation Platform
* [BookCars](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars): Car Rental Platform with Mobile App
* [Movin' In](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin): Rental Property Management Platform with Mobile App
* [wexCommerce](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce): Minimalistic and Powerful eCommerce Platform
* [Wexstream](https://github.com/aelassas/wexstream): Video Conferencing Platform

Launch your own customizable digital marketplace - whether it's an eCommerce website, car rental platform, or property rental system - with the Docker-based setups provided. Each platform comes with demo links, comprehensive documentation, Stripe payment integration, and runs efficiently on just 1GB of RAM. Deploy your business for less than $5 monthly on cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets), making these platforms perfect for entrepreneurs seeking scalable and cost-effective solutions.
